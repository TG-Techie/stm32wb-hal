## About this Fork
Why this fork exists...
1. It swaps the **P**eripheral **A**ccess **C**rate in the [eupn/stm32wb-hal](https://github.com/eupn/stm32wb-hal) package to use the [stm32-rs PAC](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32-rs) which is maintined by the stm32-rs team.
2. It updates the dependencies to the latest versions.
   1. There are still some to do (search for "TG-TODO" in the cargo.toml file)
